Keys Pressed
```
cd<space>l<tab><enter>
bash<space>t<tab><enter>
```
Explanation:
First use ```cd``` command to go in the directory we just clone. Since only ```lab7``` directory start with ```l```, type ```l``` and then ```<tab>``` to auto-complete the directory name and press enter to execute. We then run the ```test.sh``` file by first type ```bash```, and then type ```t``` and then ```<tab>``` to auto-complete the file name since only ```test.sh``` start with ```t```.

Keys Pressed
```
:set number<enter>
44gg
e
i
<rightkey>
<delete>
2
<esc>
:x<enter>
```
Explanation:
First type ```:set number<enter>``` to make the vim editor to display the line number. Next, use ```44gg``` to jump the cursor to line 44 since the code we want to fix is at line 44. After that, the ```e``` command move to the very end of the word ```index1```,then use the right key to move behind the 1, and change the mode to insert mode using ```i``` command. Then, we delete the number 1 with ```<delete>``` and type the number ```2``` in. Finally, we save the file by changing the mode to the normal mode by pressing ```esc```, and save and quit the vim editor by typing ```:x<enter>```.

## Step 8
