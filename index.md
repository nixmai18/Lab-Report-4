Keys Pressed
```
cd<space>l<tab><enter>
bash<space>t<tab><enter>
```
Explanation:
First use ```cd``` command to go in the directory we just clone. Since only ```lab7``` directory start with ```l```, type ```l``` and then ```<tab>``` to auto-complete the directory name and press enter to execute. We then run the ```test.sh``` file by first type ```bash```, and then type ```t``` and then ```<tab>``` to auto-complete the file name since only ```test.sh``` start with ```t```.
